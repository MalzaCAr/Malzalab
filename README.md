Here's my tupid homelab cluster running on whatever machines I could find that can run code

Before anything, I wanna preface this with a discaimer.

For transparency's sake, some code here was written with the assistance of LLMs. I draw the line at copy pasting code and moving over, and I try my best to actually *understand* what the LLM spit out. Also, I go with checking the official documentation for whatever problem I'm having before I resort to LLMs if nothing I try works.
